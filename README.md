# Enhanced Queue Data Structure

## Overview
This repository hosts a Python implementation of the Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) utilizing a linked list for efficient operation. It is designed for those who need a reliable and extendable queue system with the fundamental operations of enqueue (insert), dequeue (remove), and peek (retrieve). The package also features a user-friendly, interactive command-line interface (CLI) for effortless management and visualization of the queue's content.

## Features
- **Enqueue**: Add elements to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove elements from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: Look at the element at the front without removing it.
- **Size**: Get the current number of elements.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **Display**: Show all elements in the queue.
- **Clear**: Empty the queue completely.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script via a Python interpreter.
3. Use the interactive menu to perform operations on the queue.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
